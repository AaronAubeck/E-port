							<p>Within this Module there were 12 individual units, looking at ways of researching and developing skills. This was rounded up with 3 assignments. A literature review, a research presentation and a reflective piece.</p>
							<h2>Unit 1</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Selected research topic</li>
								<li>Initial Collaborative post</li>
								<li>Reasoning Quiz</li>
								<li>Reflective activity- Ethics in computing</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>The module began with unit 1 where we looked at ethics and research within the computer science field. This interested me as i am training to become a data compliance officer, eithics within data collecting is necessary to protect peoples infomation.</p>
							<h2>Unit 2</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Completed Lecture cast</li>
								<li>Continued collaborative discussion</li>
								<li>Literature review guide questions</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>Throughout unit 2 we began to look into literature reviews and how to write them. I had never needed to write a literature review before and felt quite intimidated by the task. It was through this unit that i was able to understand how to navigate, planning and researching for one and ultimately build my knowledge and confidence to write my own. </p>
							<h2>Unit 3</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Completed summary post for collaborative discussion</li>
								<li>Prepared for seminar 2</li>
								<li>watched seminar 2 recording</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>Unit 3 allowed me to investigate research design, this is a curcial aspect of conducting research. It provides a systematic plan for collecting, analysing and interpreting data to answer research questions. I learnt that a well-designed research plan is necessary to ensure that research is valid, reliable and ethical.</p>
							<h2>Unit 4</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Started research for literature review</li>
								<li>Prepared for seminar 3</li>
								<li>watched seminar 3 recording</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>This unit looked at observation methods, which are crucial for conducting primary research. They involve systematically observing and recording data to gain insights into behaviors, attitudes and experiences which will help me overall with my keystone project and further my abilities within my job. Throughout this unit i have taken note of the need to select an apropriate methodology, establish a protocol for collecting and recording data and remembering to address ethical considerations.</p>
							<h2>Unit 5</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Interview and survey design lecturecast</li>
								<li>reflective activity 2- case study</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>Gathering and understanding information given through surveys and interviews is essential for research projects and business in general. One crucial point i have learnt in this unit is that researchers should choose the method that suits thier research question, sample size and data type, and take steps to minimize potential biases and ensure data accuracy.</p>
							<h2>Unit 6</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Questionare design lecturecast</li>
								<li>Continued working on Literature review</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>This unit we looked at quantative and qualative analysis techniques and the importance of staying clear of bias. This could be concious or unconcious bias when creating a questionaire to steer a particular view or ideal.</p>
							<h2>Unit 7</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Validity and Generalisability in Research Lecturecast </li>
								<li>Initial post for collaboration 2</li>
								<li>Completed Literature review submission</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>Validility was the main focus of unit 7 and allowed me to understand the importance of transparency within research and data collecting. As well as this the Literature review was due and this took priority for the week.</p>
							<h2>Unit 8</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Summary measures and inference Lecturecast</li>
								<li>Completed response posts for collaborative discussion</li>
								<li>Began working on research topic</li>
								<li>Began statistical worksheet</li>
								<li>Watched Seminar 4 recording</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>This unit looked at Inferential Statistics and discriptive statistics. This will be helpful for my dissertation project and for my research proposal. </p>
							<h2>Unit 9</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Created summary post for collaborative discussion 2</li>
								<li>Continued statistical worksheet</li>
								<li>Watched Seminar 5 recording</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>This unit i researched about analysing qualiative data and focused on using key techniques to understand and present the data in a professional setting.</p>
							<h2>Unit 10</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Research writing lecturecast</li>
								<li>Continued Statistical worksheet</li>
								<li>Submitted research proposal presentation</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>This week i learnt about research writing and how it can be crucial to a well documented and clearly communicated presentation. It was skills learnt this unti that helped to complete and finalise my presentation. The style of writing learnt this unit will help me to communicate my ideas to fellow researchers and also help me to navigate my job and edit papers within my workplace.</p>
							<h2>Unit 11</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Checked and recreated e-portfolio</li>
								<li>Prepared for seminar 6</li>
								<li>Watched Seminar 6 recording</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>This week gave me some breathing room before handing in the final assignment. It allowed me to look back on the work throughout this module and degree in its entirely and re-evaluate how i have previously approached work. This module has reminded me of the importance of time keeping. By keeping to a plan i would be able to support myself better for the keystone project.</p>
							<h2>Unit 12</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Self test quiz</li>
								<li>End of module assignment- Reflection</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>Unit 12 has allowed me to understand that a good project management plan can go a long way. Keeping to schedule and understanding time restraints is imperetive to the success of a project.</p>
