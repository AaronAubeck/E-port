							<h1 class="major">SEPM_PCOM7E Software Engineering Project Management</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Within this Module there were 12 individual units, all with the aim to research into ways of supporting software engineering management projects from failure. This was rounded up with 3 assignments 2 of which were group work based and the third being a reflective piece.</p>
							<h2>Unit 1</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Lecture cast “Introduction to Software Engineering Project Management.” </li>
								<li>Initial Collaborative post</li>
								<li>Contacted group for intial meeting</li>
								<li>prepared for group work</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>This week I began the software engineering project management module, this is my last module before moving onto my dissertation/keystone project, so ideas and key skills learnt from this module are definitely impacting my choices in regard to my further projects. Project management is not a theme I have previously researched or worked upon so many of the theories and tasks given are quite new to me. Learning the basic concepts this week has been imperative for the continued success of this module.</p>
							<h2>Unit 2</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Created coffee machine Gerkin requirements</li>
								<li>Continued collaborative discussion</li>
								<li>Watched seminar 1</li>
								<li>Began weekly team meetings</li>
							<p> </p>Throughout this unit I learnt about the requirements process and developed an interesting skill of applying Gerkin requirements to scenarios. The scenario I chose was a coffee machine from the perspective of a user, supplier, and engineer. It is a relatively simple concept however is a good tool to keep in mind for further projects in future and it allows you to understand the basic needs for the product. 
							<h2>Unit 3</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Joined weekly group meeting for report assignment</li>
								<li>Completed collaborative post</li>
								<li>completed lecturecast "Estimating, planning and risk"</li>
							  </ul>
							<p> This unit I continued my collaborative discussion submission and researched risk, estimating and planning. Risk is a big part of my day-to-day life as a data security officer so investigating data protection risks is a comfortable area for myself. However, data isn’t the only risk to think about within SE management projects. Corporate growth, estimation errors and profits are all areas I have learnt of that are just as important as data protection. </p>
							<h2>Unit 4</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Joined group meeting for report assignment</li>
								<li>Created risk register for report assignment</li>
								<li>researched into COCOMO estimation tool</li>
							  </ul>
							<p> Unit 4 was a continuation of unit 3 and its basic themes however continued into more detail in areas such as different risk areas and ways to mitigate risks.  One area I was quite interested in was learning about enterprise-wide risk management programs. Effective programs deter risks and allow smooth working in management projects on a bigger scale. </p>
							<h2>Unit 5</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Completed Lecture cast "user experience"</li>
								<li>Joined weekly meeting to work on report assignment</li>
							  </ul>
							<p> Within this unit user experience was at the forefront with recent developments in the research area being noted throughout. The increased use of user experience (UX) to deliver requirements is exciting to see. Implementation of users input or needs increases the usefulness of applications and helps navigate development and determine important requirements. This is not an area I have known or thought about previously so was interesting to look into. </p>
							<h2>Unit 6</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Submitted Project report assignment</li>
								<li>Submitted peer review</li>
								<li>joined weekly group meeting and informed of peer review</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>Unit 6 looked at test driven development, this was a methodology that I myself had not experienced before, although I’ve not had much experience with most coding tools or methods. Testing in its entirely has been something of an enigma to me, before starting this degree I had never worked on software development or testing said software. Many parts of this course haven’t been taught and have been written to insinuate that these things should be known already. This has been quite the learning curve but interesting and challenging, which is something I enjoy. This week allowed me to look at automated testing, using Pytest and explaining my development and testing into the advanced level. </p>
							<h2>Unit 7</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Completed Lecture cast "software development lifecycles"</li>
								<li>Completed unit 7 e-portfolio activity</li>
								<li>joined weekly group meeting to begin transcript</li>
							  </ul>
							<p> Within unit 7 I looked into Software development life cycles which has been a reoccurring theme throughout the entirety of the degree. They are an important part of software development and agile being the most commonly used approach and one of my favourites to work from. It is these cycles that support and structure development within SE management projects. </p>
							<h2>Unit 8</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Planned final presentation</li>
								<li>joined group weekly meeting and discussion</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>Throughout this unit I looked back at the internet of things, sensors, and automation in alliance with python structures. Looking at python structures in regard to my team’s work and the group presentation was difficult but interesting into the development of our contingency plan in the wake of the complaints to the original machine design for the formative work. It was determined in this instance to have two team members carry out the coding part of the work and the rest of us complete the presentation. Throughout this we kept to our roles given initially.  </p>
							<h2>Unit 9</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Completed Lecture cast "Quality management strategy"</li>
								<li>Joined weekly group meeting and confirmed slides and pricing</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>Unit 9 brought in the idea of quality management which is a concept I have worked with previously. I felt comfortable going into this unit however still learnt new concepts and skills throughout. Quality should be seen as a deliberate process throughout the development cycle alongside testing to ensure a strong final product.  </p>
							<h2>Unit 10</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Finished presentation slides</li>
								<li>Confirmed final requirements in grouo meeting</li>
								<li>watched seminar 5 recording</li>
							  </ul>
							<p> Linters were investigated this week. I had previously learnt a little about linters however this solidified my knowledge of their use. The majority of this week was used to work on the group presentation and make sure recordings were completed. This was quite stressful for myself as I am not very confident with speaking due to fumbling words and stuttering however, I pulled through and managed to record my part with minimal mistakes although this did take over an hour for a 3-minute recording as I had to restart multiple times.</p>
							<h2>Unit 11</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Completed Lecture cast "Future trends"</li>
								<li>Finished Presentation</li>
								<li>Submitted group presentation and peer review</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>If I thought unit 10 was a busy week I was mistaken as unit 11 was hectic. The last few bits needed to be completed for the presentation as well as reflective work for my e-portfolio and the assessments for my group and the work done with the team. It was interesting to break from all the hectic group work to read about future trends in SE project management. This mostly looked into areas such as Artificial intelligence which has been heavily focused upon in the news recently.  </p>
							<h2>Unit 12</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Prepared for final seminar</li>
								<li>Handed in E-portfolio</li>
								<li>Handed in reflection assignment</li>
							  </ul>
							<p>This week was focused on the completion of left over work from previous modules and continuing the investigation into future trends. Overall, the week was busy, and I felt quite stressed about handing in a complete module of work. Trying to implement skills and knowledge from all 12 weeks while not becoming overwhelmed was difficult. </p>
